# parotta

parotta is a next level meta-framework for react that runs only on the bun js runtime.
It uses File system routing with SSR with streaming + CSR as the method to render pages. Basically a MPA + SPA Transitional App.
It is very opionated and has set of idiomatic ways of doing things.

### Todo
1. Prefetching assets
2. Add build step
3. Deploy to Docker, Deno deploy, Cloudflare workers, Vercel edge functions, Bun edge (whenever it releases)
4. Hydrate fetch cache
