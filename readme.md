parotta is a next level meta-framework for react that runs only on edge runtimes mainly bun.
It uses File System routing with streaming SSR + CSR as the method to render pages. Basically a MPA + SPA Transitional App.
It is very opionated and has set of idiomatic ways of doing things.

### Todo
1. Add build step
2. Deploy to Docker, Deno deploy, Vercel edge functions, Cloudflare workers, Bun edge (whenever it releases)
3. Hydrate fetch cache
