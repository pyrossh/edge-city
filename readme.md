parotta is a next level meta-framework for react that runs only on the bun js runtime.
It uses File system routing with SSR with streaming + CSR as the method to render pages. Basically a MPA + SPA Transitional App.
It is very opionated and has set of idiomatic ways of doing things.

### Todo
1. Hydrate fetch cache
2. Improve css loading

5. Deploy to Docker, Deno deploy, Cloudflare workers, Vercel edge functions, Bun edge (whenever it releases)
